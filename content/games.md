- ## Mushroom Cloud

    - Actual Game: Deck of cards is fanned out around a full unopened beer can. Players take turns selecting cards, guessing the color, and placing the cards on the top of the beer can. If the player guesses the color correctly, then they give a sip, else, they take a sip. The cards must be placed such that at least 1/3 of the card overhangs the previously placed card(s), effectively creating a mushroom cloud. Whoever causes the cards to fall, loses and drinks the full beer in the middle.

    - Discord Version: Players take turns guessing the color of a drawn card (automatic random selection). If the player guesses the color correctly, then they give a sip, else, they take a sip. The game will end at a predetermined, randomly selected card. The player who is guessing when this happens, loses and finishes their beverage.

I grew up playing drinking games with my friends and family - a favorite pastime of mine. Time passed, we got older, had kids, started working more, and our schedules rarely allow for us to do this any more - enter barroom hero. An outlet for playing the same card games we used to but from a distance. We're having fun with this and hope others can too. All ideas, game suggestions, and support are both welcomed and appreciated!


Cheers!
