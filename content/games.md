- ## Mushroom Cloud (Free)

    - Actual Game: Deck of cards is fanned out around a full unopened beer can. Players take turns selecting cards, guessing the color, and placing the cards on the top of the beer can. If the player guesses the color correctly, then they give a sip, else, they take a sip. The cards must be placed such that at least 1/3 of the card overhangs the previously placed card(s), effectively creating a mushroom cloud. Whoever causes the cards to fall, loses and drinks the full beer in the middle.

    - Discord Version: Players take turns guessing the color of a drawn card (automatic random selection). If the player guesses the color correctly, then they give a sip, else, they take a sip. The game will end at a predetermined, randomly selected card. The player who is guessing when this happens, loses and finishes their beverage.

- ## Horse Races (Premium)

    - Actual Game: The four aces are removed from a deck of cards - these are the "horses". The dealer places a line of face down cards (generally around 6 cards) perpendicular to the horses, creating a "track". All players place bets (sips of beer) on the horses. Once all bets have been made, the dealer begins drawing cards from the deck (not the track) and placing them face up for all to see. If the suit of the drawn card matches the suit of the horse, then the horse advances forward one space, two spaces for face cards. Once all horses have advanced past the first card of the track, the first card of the track is flipped. If the suit of the flipped card matches the suit of the horse, then the horse moves backward one space, two spaces for face cards. The first horse to reach the end of the track wins. Whoever bet on that horse gets to deal out their sips, and everyone else drinks their bet.

    - Discord Version: Very similar to the actual game, but the dealing is automated. The cards are not shown to prevent clutter in the channel!

- ## Brawl (Free)

    - Actual Game: N/A

    - Discord Version: This is just a fun way to poke someone or could be used as a tie breaker. Simply select a channel member you'd like to brawl with and the winner is chosen at random!
