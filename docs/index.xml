      <description>Mushroom Cloud (Free)   Actual Game: Deck of cards is fanned out around a full unopened beer can. Players take turns selecting cards, guessing the color, and placing the cards on the top of the beer can. If the player guesses the color correctly, then they give a sip, else, they take a sip. The cards must be placed such that at least 1/3 of the card overhangs the previously placed card(s), effectively creating a mushroom cloud.</description>
